Sales Data Analysis Project

Overview
This project focuses on analyzing a sizable sales dataset to extract insightful information that can guide business decisions. The dataset contains information on orders, returns, and non-returns across different market segments, product categories, and regions.

Objective
The primary objectives of this analysis are to:

Compute revenue measures such as total sales.
Analyze sales trends over time.
Determine the best-selling products.
Build visualizations to effectively convey findings.
This project aims to demonstrate my capacity to work with and extract knowledge from large datasets, providing data-driven suggestions for improving sales tactics.
